Hello,

I'm a hobbyist who has begun branching into the world of coding, pcb design and just the electronic "maker" world in general. 

I am currently working on small hobby farm automation projects, most notably, chicken coop automation and garden irrigation based on soil moisture levels. 

My programming, electrical engineering and CAD knowledge is entirely self taught, so expect weird coding, strange BOM decisions and enclosures with odd design choices.
I'm open to comments and critiques on basically everything, including any and all of my git-repositories and projects. 

Current Projects:

CoopCommand (Automated Chicken Coop Project): https://github.com/hms-11/CoopCommand
ZoneCommand (Automated Gargen Irrigation Project, far less complete): https://github.com/hms-11/ZoneCommand
